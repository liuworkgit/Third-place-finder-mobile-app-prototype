# Thrd - A third place finder app
A prototype mockup of Thrd, an app that helps users find third places for connection and relaxation. Created for UBC's INFO 300 2023/24 final project.

In this project, I was the main UI designer, and was thus responsible for the layout of the app's interface. This repository contains the work that I did on the prototype.
